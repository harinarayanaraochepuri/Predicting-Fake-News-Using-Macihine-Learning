With the increasing popularity of social media, many individuals now rely on these platforms for news
consumption rather than traditional media outlets. However, this shift has also facilitated the spread of fake news,
which can have harmful impacts on individuals and society. Our project presents a Machine Learning model
based on Logistic Regression to tackle fake news detection. By analysing news events through classification
algorithms, the model determines the probability of the news being genuine or fake. With an impressive 98%
accuracy rate, this system empowers users to distinguish between real and fake news effectively.
